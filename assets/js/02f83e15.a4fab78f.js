It is typically placed along power lines, though it can be placed anywhere a certain distance above the ground. It is a multi-faceted device, that can detect wildfires by meausuring behavior in the climate that indicates that a fire is coming or present, scanning to see fire within its cameras, and can even contact authorities automatically when it has detected something.

The website may be used by owners of the Firebird, admins that control the owner\'s usage, or even counties that have installed the Firebird for their protection. I worked on patching up small bugs in the website and redesigning the UI. For example, the most recent task I completed was to redesign a few radio buttons, which previously needed to be manually saved by clicking on a "save" button, and could only be deselected by clicking a "discard" button. I changed the buttons such that selections were automatically saved without the use of a save button and a button could be deselected by clicking on it when it is selected. I also solved other issues such as bugs that came up when reloading a page, making a tool-tip where there was a lack of information, and patching up some messy logic with tighter if statements.'))}h.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);
