After all, I'm pursuing a career in computer science and business, and in order to be successful in such career, you need to be creative; you need to be able to recognize problems, let alone solve them. This has worried me for some time, because I've felt like I have a tough time remembering or acknowledging \"bugs\" that come up, but though it was hard when I first started, the more I spent time on this activity the more the thoughts came flooding in, until at its peak I look around and everything is a bug.
