My interviewees who said they did like LA nightlife said that the only good thing about LA nightlife is it's house parties culture, and those who said they didn't said the same thing. A lot of it comes down to whether someone likes house parties or is able to get into them. Speaking of, my next insight was that LA is very clique-y. In order to do anything-houseparties-you have to know people. Ideally, you want to be a part of a community that is friendly to all who belong to it, and you can meet people through members of that community. It's difficult to just meet people by going to a place. Finally, there seems to be a tension among my interviewees between wanting to and actively trying to be a part of LA culture, and being tired and worn out from it. People say they want to be a part of it, but when asked what they do to do that, they say that they've given up, making it seem like this is an impossible task."),(0,a.kt)("h2",{id:"2---my-presentation"},"2 - My Presentation"),(0,a.kt)("iframe",{src:"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vTS7EkvD9OUEQtMd1XWdQDT4LetTGGaHJ4Bn-NE6pSZMm_fiILoq69EMdC-dKvNw5tjPvyeCaUcfVK8/embed?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000",frameborder:"0",width:"480",height:"299",allowfullscreen:"true",mozallowfullscreen:"true",webkitallowfullscreen:"true"}),(0,a.kt)("h2",{id:"3---analysis"},"3 - Analysis"),(0,a.kt)("h3",{id:"1"},"1"),(0,a.kt)("p",null,(0,a.kt)("img",{alt:"Azita Needfinding",src:n(7346).Z,width:"1662",height:"918"})),(0,a.kt)("h3",{id:"2"},"2"),(0,a.kt)("p",null,(0,a.kt)("img",{alt:"Nick Needfinding",src:n(3610).Z,width:"1662",height:"930"})),(0,a.kt)("h3",{id:"3"},"3"),(0,a.kt)("p",null,(0,a.kt)("img",{alt:"Dylan Needfinding",src:n(575).Z,width:"1664",height:"940"})),(0,a.kt)("h3",{id:"4---ari"},"4 - Ari"),(0,a.kt)("p",null,"\u201cI completely disagree with that(LA has bad night life).\u201d\n\u201cThe one thing about los angeles that I think sucks is that it\u2019s kinda hard to meet new people, if you don\u2019t know anybody it\u2019s hard to get into anything.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s very status and money based.
