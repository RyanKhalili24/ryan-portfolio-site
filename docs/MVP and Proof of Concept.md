# MVP and Proof of Concept

## What is your project Idea?

A restaurant(plus maybe more later on?) finder for just LA(plus maybe more later on?) in which the user inputs parameters like party size, dietary restrictions, personal preferences, current location, preference to go to certain areas, budget per person, ability for each person to pay separately and diversity of pricing at the restaurant, etc., and the AI for the application uses its normal chatGPT database + the database I give it(which I’m paying for) and gives a list of restaurants and makes proper, fair compromises. Prioritizes certain features like dietary restrictions over personal preferences, and later on even checks the restaurants for availability at given times on certain

## What is your MVP

Still needs the chatgpt database and data pulled from other articles/sources to prioritize, will take in less parameters and only do a smaller area, like for example beverly hills or sherman oaks

## What is your proof of concept?

Local app on my computer, not sure if this should be an application or website? Don’t really know what to put here

## What are “the nice to haves”?

Covering all of LA, covering more cities, and especially going beyond just restaurants
