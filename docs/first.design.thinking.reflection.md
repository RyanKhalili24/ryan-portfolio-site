# First Design Thinking Reflection

## Step 1 - Needfinding

I thought needfinding was super awesome. After all, I'm pursuing a career in computer science and business, and in order to be successful in such career, you need to be creative; you need to be able to recognize problems, let alone solve them. This has worried me for some time, because I've felt like I have a tough time remembering or acknowledging "bugs" that come up, but though it was hard when I first started, the more I spent time on this activity the more the thoughts came flooding in, until at its peak I look around and everything is a bug. This is not just an exercise I'm excited to do in this class more, but one I'll take with me for the rest of my life.

## Step 2 - Defining

This one was alright too. What I liked about it most was that the specific way we had to formulate the questions forced me to think about alterior solutions to a problem; it forced me to think about both sides. For example, with your book-bag water bottle issue, we'd frame the question such that it can include the possibility that the water bottle needs fixing, not the bag. Though I understand its usefulness, it was a little tedious.

## Step 3 - Ideating

This was good in theory, and super fun because of all the jokes, but was also the problem with it. I can't say I'm not guilty, I had my fun making jokes too, but at the end of the day I didn't get much out of this. I still hope we do more of it though because I think it will be more successful in the future.

## Step 4 - Prototyping

I absolutely loved this step because I'm a very kinesthetic learner and just by interacting with actual materials I'd need to use to make a product I learned so much more about how I wanted the product to look and behave. I made so much progress from just an hour's worth of time in the Maker's Space because it's so much easier to learn about your problem and the proper way to solve it when you leave the realm of theory. I'm very excited to continue doing this more.
