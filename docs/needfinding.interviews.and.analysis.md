# Needfinding Interviews and Analysis

## 1 - Top Three Insights From my Interviews

My first, most obvious insight, was that LA nightlife and social life is dominated by house parties. My interviewees who said they did like LA nightlife said that the only good thing about LA nightlife is it's house parties culture, and those who said they didn't said the same thing. A lot of it comes down to whether someone likes house parties or is able to get into them. Speaking of, my next insight was that LA is very clique-y. In order to do anything-houseparties-you have to know people. Ideally, you want to be a part of a community that is friendly to all who belong to it, and you can meet people through members of that community. It's difficult to just meet people by going to a place. Finally, there seems to be a tension among my interviewees between wanting to and actively trying to be a part of LA culture, and being tired and worn out from it. People say they want to be a part of it, but when asked what they do to do that, they say that they've given up, making it seem like this is an impossible task.

### 4 - Ari

“I completely disagree with that(LA has bad night life).”
“The one thing about los angeles that I think sucks is that it’s kinda hard to meet new people, if you don’t know anybody it’s hard to get into anything.”
“It’s very status and money based. There’s a lot of good people I know that because of lack of status and money, don’t have any friends.”
“There are not spots where you can really meet people.”
“People don’t trust anybody here.”
“People are so easy to drop someone quickly, even though they act like the people they’re with will be with them forever. It’s very fake.”
“You make the friend by doing things for people, you keep them with loyalty and trust.”

Ari's overall opinion of LA is pretty harsh. He said he enjoys LA and its nightlife, but he also explains how sad the reality of going out and making friends is here. Relationships in LA, according to him, are largely transactional. However, it's not all bad. Them being transactional doesn't stop him from making the most out of them and enjoying his young adulthood in LA. It'd be ideal for him to be in a different culture, but he's willing to put in the effort to make the most out of it.

### 5 - Evan

“The thing about LA house parties though is the people who are running them think they’re running a club, they have lists and security. Because of the lack of clubs, all the kids who throw house parties try to simulate clubs in their house parties.”
“LA is really big on mutual friends. I meet someone who meets someone who meets someone…”
“I really dislike it, cause I’ve always been against thinking you’re too good for other people. It’s because we live in LA that people have this celebrity mindset.”
“I think when you’re a social person, no matter where you go, you’ll meet people.

Evan agreed with most in saying that LA has bad nightlife, though like Ari, he makes do. He agreed with everyone that LA's nightlife, at least at his age, is centered arond house parties. However, he's had experience in other states and countries, and explained that pretty much everywhere outside of LA, there's hardly any exclusivity, and you don't have to work so hard or have so many connections to consistently have a good time.
